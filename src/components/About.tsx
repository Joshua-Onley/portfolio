                  I have recently completed my Master's degree in Advanced Computer Science from the University
                  of Birmingham, where I am predicted a Distinction. My academic background has equipped me with strong
                  foundations in technology, software engineering, and full-stack web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm passionate about building software that solves real-world problems. My most recent project 'Adventure Code' is a full-stack web-application
                  that supports coding education. For more details scroll down to my Projects section.
                </p>

                  Beyond coding, I'm an endurance sports enthusiast who has completed a 100-mile charity bike ride, helping to raise over Â£600 for charity. I have been regularly playing
                  team sports such as football and hockey from a young age and I frequently go to the gym for strength training. In addition to sports, I also enjoy playing strategy games such as chess.
